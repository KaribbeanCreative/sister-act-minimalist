## 📜 Project history
Sister Act was the most successful comedy in the 1990s, generating $231 million worldwide 🌎.

The poster represents the character’s two lifestyles.
On one side the singer Dolores Van Cartier who performs every night in front of casino 🎰 players. She is the mistress of the cabaret manager, Vince LaRocca.

And on the other hand, her new life as a Catholic nun under the name of Sister Marie-Clarence. Forced to hide among the nuns she will have one and only task, to take care of the choir.
